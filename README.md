Copy_Move_Forgery_With_Similar_But_Genuine_Object

1. Code for the paper: "Copy move forgery detection with similar but genuine objects", ICIP 2017.

2. For single image: run process_image.m

3. For the whole coverage dataset: run run_coverage.m

4. Other files are called as function.

5. Steps for forgery detection:
  1. RLBP feature extraction.
  2. Feature Matching.
  3. Clustering.
  4. Homography transformation estimation.
  5. Forgery detection.
  
 6. For more detail, check the paper.
